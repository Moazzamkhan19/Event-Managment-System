Cricket Management System â€“ Java, JavaFX, File Handling, OOP
Built a GUI-based desktop application using JavaFX for managing a cricket match event.
The system includes user authentication, data persistence via file handling, and object-oriented design with classes for Person, SeatType, Umpire, and SecurityGuard.
It stores and manages individual records such as CNIC, name, ID, seat details, and sponsor information using ArrayList.
Core features include seat booking and cancellation, dynamic price calculation based on seat type (VIP, Executive, Economy), and real-time updates for umpire and guard assignments. 
The system supports searching and replacing records, ensuring efficient data management and interaction through a responsive JavaFX interface.
